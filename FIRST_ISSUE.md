# First Issue: Project Setup and Initial Development

## Issue Title
**[SETUP] Initialize Collatz Data Science Project Development Environment**

## Description
This is the first issue to set up the development environment and begin working on the Collatz Data Science project. This issue will establish the foundation for all future development work.

## Objectives
- [ ] Set up the sandbox development environment
- [ ] Verify all services are running correctly
- [ ] Create initial project structure
- [ ] Implement basic Collatz conjecture analysis
- [ ] Set up data pipeline foundations
- [ ] Create initial dashboard prototype

## Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Start sandbox environment: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.sandbox.yml up -d`
- [ ] Verify services:
  - [ ] App running on http://localhost:8083
  - [ ] Jupyter Lab on http://localhost:8891
  - [ ] Database on localhost:5435
  - [ ] Redis on localhost:6379
- [ ] Test health endpoint: http://localhost:8083/health

### 2. Core Implementation
- [ ] Create `src/collatz/core.py` with basic Collatz functions
- [ ] Implement sequence generation algorithm
- [ ] Add sequence analysis functions (length, max value, etc.)
- [ ] Create data models for storing results

### 3. Data Pipeline
- [ ] Set up database tables using SQL scripts in `/sql/`
- [ ] Create data ingestion functions
- [ ] Implement batch processing for large number ranges
- [ ] Add data validation and error handling

### 4. Dashboard Development
- [ ] Create basic Streamlit dashboard in `/dashboard/`
- [ ] Add visualization for Collatz sequences
- [ ] Implement interactive number input
- [ ] Add statistical analysis views

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for data pipeline
- [ ] Test dashboard functionality
- [ ] Verify all environments work correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
- All services start successfully in sandbox environment
- Basic Collatz sequence generation works
- Data can be stored and retrieved from database
- Simple dashboard displays Collatz analysis
- All tests pass
- Documentation is updated

## Priority
**High** - This is the foundation for all future work

## Environment
**Sandbox** - All development work happens here

## Estimated Time
2-3 days for complete setup and basic implementation

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Create issues for advanced analysis features
2. Set up performance optimization tasks
3. Plan data visualization enhancements
4. Design API endpoints for external access

## How to Create This Issue on GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Issues" tab
3. Click "New Issue"
4. Use the title: `[SETUP] Initialize Collatz Data Science Project Development Environment`
5. Copy the content from the "Description" section onwards
6. Add labels: `enhancement`, `setup`, `high-priority`
7. Assign to yourself
8. Create the issue

## Getting Started Commands

```bash
# Start the sandbox environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.sandbox.yml up -d

# Check if services are running
docker-compose ps

# View logs if needed
docker-compose logs app
docker-compose logs jupyter

# Access Jupyter Lab
# Open http://localhost:8891 and use token: sandbox_token

# Test the application
curl http://localhost:8083/health
```

This first issue will establish the foundation for your Collatz Data Science project and get you started with active development in the sandbox environment.
