## 🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
```python
# Example dashboard structure
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px

def main():
    st.set_page_config(
        page_title="Collatz Conjecture Explorer",
        page_icon="🔢",
        layout="wide"
    )
    
    # Sidebar navigation
    page = st.sidebar.selectbox(
        "Choose a page",
        ["Sequence Explorer", "Batch Analysis", "Statistics", "Research"]
    )
    
    if page == "Sequence Explorer":
        sequence_explorer_page()
    # ... other pages
```
