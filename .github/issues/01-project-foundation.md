## 🎯 Objective
Establish the foundational infrastructure and development environment for the Collatz Data Science project.

## 📋 Task Description
This is the first issue to set up the development environment and begin working on the Collatz Data Science project. This issue will establish the foundation for all future development work.

## ✅ Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Start sandbox environment: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.sandbox.yml up -d`
- [ ] Verify services:
  - [ ] App running on http://localhost:8083
  - [ ] Jupyter Lab on http://localhost:8889
  - [ ] Database on localhost:5435
  - [ ] Redis on localhost:6379 (if configured)
- [ ] Test health endpoint: http://localhost:8083/health

### 2. Docker Environment Configuration
- [ ] Verify `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- [ ] Test `docker-compose.sandbox.yml` for experimental features
- [ ] Validate `docker-compose.qa.yml` for quality assurance
- [ ] Validate `docker-compose.uat.yml` for user acceptance testing
- [ ] Validate `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production deployment
- [ ] Verify all services start correctly across environments
- [ ] Test port configurations and service connectivity

### 3. Project Structure Validation
- [ ] Verify `src/collatz/` package structure exists
- [ ] Confirm `dashboard/` directory for web interface
- [ ] Check `notebooks/` for Jupyter analysis
- [ ] Validate `tests/` directory structure
- [ ] Confirm `sql/` directory for database scripts
- [ ] Check `reports/` for generated analysis reports

### 4. Configuration Management
- [ ] Verify environment-specific `.env` files are properly configured
- [ ] Test database connection strings
- [ ] Validate logging configuration
- [ ] Check security settings and secrets management

### 5. Development Tools Setup
- [ ] Test Black code formatting
- [ ] Verify isort import sorting
- [ ] Test flake8 linting
- [ ] Verify mypy type checking
- [ ] Test pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Validate pytest configuration

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All Docker environments start without errors
- [ ] Health check endpoints respond correctly (200 status)
- [ ] Development tools run without configuration issues
- [ ] Project structure follows Python best practices
- [ ] All environment files are properly configured and ignored by Git
- [ ] Database connections work across all environments

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose installed
- [ ] Python 3.11+ environment
- [ ] PostgreSQL database connectivity
- [ ] All dependencies from requirements.txt installed

## 📊 Environment Testing
- [ ] Development (Sandbox) ✅
- [ ] QA Environment
- [ ] UAT Environment
- [ ] Production Environment (configuration only)

## 🚀 Priority
**Critical** - This is the foundation for all other development work.

## 📝 Notes
- This issue blocks all other development tasks
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set
- Document any configuration issues encountered
- Test with the updated database password: `weaknaweak27`
